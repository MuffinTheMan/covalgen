CodeEval solution template generator script.

Begin program with `ruby generate.rb` and follow the prompts to setup your solution template.

Once finished with the setup, you will find your template under the folder that corresponds to your challenge's difficulty level. For example:

`moderate/incomplete/flavius_josephus-rb/`

## To Do:

- Create settings file for user customization (author header, for example)
- Create `finish` script to run when finished in order to move file to the completed folder
- Automatically change to the new directory after setup script
