# covalgen

CodeEval solution template generator script.

Begin program with `ruby generate.rb` and follow the prompts to setup your solution template.

Once finished with the setup, you will find your template under the folder that corresponds to your challenge's difficulty level. For example:

`moderate/incomplete/flavius_josephus-rb/`

Once you have successfully submitted your solution and wish to move it from the `incomplete` folder to the `complete` folder, run `. ./finish.sh`

## To Do:

- Create settings file for user customization (author header, for example)
- Automatically change to the new directory after setup script
